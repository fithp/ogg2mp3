ogg2mp3

This version is based on mp32ogg by Nathan Walp from where I took
most of the code. A very small piece was inspired by the original
ogg2mp3 by David Ljung Madison. I rudely usurped the name ogg2mp3
because a) I can't think of any better and b) David seems to have
stopped development of ogg2mp3. Nevertheless, I respect the work
done by both authors and named them in the doc files and the
script itself.

Both authors released their work under an Artistic license. I've
included a copy of the one from

http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php

As I will no longer mantain the script, I release it under the GPLv2,

If anyone wants to maintain the script, feel free to do so.
