ogg2mp3

Why another ogg2mp3?

I looked for something that would turn my perfectly legal ogg files
into mp3 files because my standalone DVD player cannot handle oggs.
After some search I found ogg2mp3 at marginalhacks.com and used
that for quite some time without major changes.

Well, ogg2mp3 by David Ljung Madison worked but had some shortcomings.
Searching for ideas I found Nathan Walp's mp32ogg which looked like
a sound base to work on. Frankly, I don't understand why he didn't
provide for both ways in a single script. So I took the liberty of
taking his code and turn it upside down. If Nathan ever wants to
incorporate my changes in a unified script, I will gladly stop working
on this one.

Until then, feel free to send me patches to this address

UPDATE: James Ausmus <james.ausmus.code@gmail.com>

Do test the script. Right now I only tested it with well-behaved oggs.
I'd be interested to know what happens with oggs that report weird
bitrates or sampling frequencies or have broken tags.

******** I will no longer maintain the script *****************
**** Please don't send any further patches to me **************

Have Fun

UPDATE: As Mark no longer maintains this script, and it is GPLv2, I
have taken over maintainership of this. I will actively maintain this
as well as I can, so please send me patches/updates/fixes/requests, 
and anything else, and I will do my best to accomodate. :)
